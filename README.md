# Tugas-Pemograman-2---Reasoning

Introduction to Artificial Intelligence lecture
**1. Task Description**
   Given a bengkel.xlsx file in the form of a data set of 100 car repair shops in the city of Bandung with two attributes. 
Bandung with two attributes: Service Quality (real number 1-100; the higher the better) and Price (real number 1-10, the higher the more expensive). Build a system based on Fuzzy Logic-based system to select the 10 best car repair shops in Bandung. The system reads the input file bengkel.xlsx file and outputs a ranking.xlsx file containing the 10 best workshop numbers/IDs and their scores (Define output). 
and their scores (Defuzzification output).

**Points that you should design and analyze:** 
-  Number and Linguistic Name of each input attribute
-  Input Membership Function Shape and Limits
-  Inference Rules
-  Defuzzification method
-  Output Membership Function Shape and Limit (according to Defuzzification method)

**The process that you have to implement into the program (can be a function/procedure):**
-  Reading data from a file
-  Fuzzification
-  Inference
-  Defuzzification
-  Saving the output to a file

**2. Output Program**
   With the problem described above, your program output is a file called 
rank.xlsx file that contains the 10 best workshop numbers/IDs and their scores (Defuzzification output).
